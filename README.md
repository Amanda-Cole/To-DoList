# Overview

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I have created a basic todo list program that allows you to add, edit, and delete items from your list.

The software that I wrote uses functions and eventListeners to ensure the user has a pleasant experience with the program.  The program begins when the addButton is clicked.  The ability to edit and delete the added entry is then open for the user to select.

This program allowed me to practice writing a functional webbased application that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I was able to practice design, functionality, and the ability to call HTML Elments in JavaScript.
